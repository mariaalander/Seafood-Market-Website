# Seafood-Market-Website
A fun project where I built a fake restaurant website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also played around with an API to make it more interactive and practiced some responsive design.

To start:
- have python3 installed on your computer
- then in the terminal, run: python -m http.server 8000
- open up your browser
- put in http://localhost:8000 as URL
- find the html files for the website and everything will work
